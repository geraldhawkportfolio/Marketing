## PITCH
A goal without strategy is simply a dream. 

When it comes to setting obtainable, life-changing goals for the future, there is far more involved than setting your sites on something you want to achieve. 

Give users the ability to state a goal (and share with others for accountability) and to break those goals down into small bite-sized steps

## PROJECT MVP
- [ ] User can register/login and create a goal planning profile. 
- [ ] User can add their goals and break them down into 3-5 smaller steps (goals). 
- [ ] User can share their goals.
- [ ] User can view the goals of others in order to find resources to help them achieve their own. ]

## STRETCH
- [ ] user can set reminders for the small steps they create in achieving their goal
- [ ] user can add images and/or videos as they track their journey to success.
- [ ] user can add comments to other users' goals and allow comments to their own
